This Ecommerce Website is an end to end machine learning Project

1. Problem Statement: In this Project we are trying to predict yearly amount spent by user based on usage of application, membership plans and many other features as mentioned in the dataset.
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) : This helps us to know more about our dataset.
3. Modelling : We use 4 Linear Regression models namely
              * Linear regression
              * Lasso Regression
              * Ridge Regression
              * Elastic Net Regression
4. Evaluation : By using these model we compare their results and they are pretty good and produce almost same results. But we Found Lasso Regression works best.
